# grail_sort_cpp
##### About
 This repository contains a C++17 implementation of Andrey Astrelin's GrailSort, a block merge sorting algorithm.
##### Usage
 As a block merge sort, GrailSort can run without allocating an auxiliary buffer. However, the algorithm also accepts additional memory to speed up merging operations.
